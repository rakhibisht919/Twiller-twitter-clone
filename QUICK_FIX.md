# 🚀 QUICK FIX - Restart Your Twiller App

## 🔧 The Problem
Your backend server is working, but your React app can't connect to it. This usually happens when:
- React started before the backend was ready
- There's a cached connection issue
- Browser cache is causing problems

## ⚡ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Stop Everything
```powershell
# Stop all node processes (this will stop both React and the server)
taskkill /f /im node.exe
```

### Step 2: Start Backend First
```powershell
cd D:\twiller-twitterclone\server
npm start
```
**Wait until you see:** `✅ SMTP server is ready to send messages!`

### Step 3: Start React App (in a NEW terminal/command prompt)
```powershell
cd D:\twiller-twitterclone\twiller
npm start
```

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Edge)
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Del`
3. Clear "Cached images and files"
4. Refresh the page (`F5`)

## 🧪 Test if It's Working

### Option A: Use the diagnostic page
1. Open: `D:\twiller-twitterclone\server\test-api.html` 
2. Click "Run All Tests"
3. All should be green ✅

### Option B: Check your Twiller homepage
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. You should now see posts loading
3. Search should work in the Explore page

## 🔍 If Still Not Working

### Check Network in Browser:
1. Press `F12` in browser
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for red/failed requests to `localhost:5001`

### If you see CORS errors:
The server has CORS enabled, but if there are issues, restart both servers in this exact order.
